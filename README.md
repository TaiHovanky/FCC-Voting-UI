# FCC-Voting-UI

This is an app that allows users to create polls, vote on them, and view data visualizations (based on FreeCodeCamp's voting app). For this project, I decided to split the UI and the API for modularity. My learning goal with the overall voting app project is to learn more about MongoDB and Node on the backend and to practice with React and GraphQL on the frontend.

The UI can be run by downloading the project files, navigating to the project, and running "npm run start". Download the code for the Voting API project and run it in a different terminal window (also using "npm run start"). Then navigate to localhost:4000 on your browser to view the application.
