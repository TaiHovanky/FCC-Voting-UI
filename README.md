# FCC-Voting-UI

This is an app that allows users to create polls, vote on them, and view data visualizations (based on FreeCodeCamp's voting app). For this project, I decided to split the UI and the API for modularity. My learning goal with the overall voting app project is to learn more about MongoDB and Node on the backend and to practice with React and GraphQL on the frontend.

The UI can be run by downloading the project files, navigating to the project, and running "npm run start". This will run the UI on a different port than the API.
